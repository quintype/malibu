# Progressive image Implementaion 

Wherever the Gumlet config is set, modify the Gumlet config by adding `srcset: true`. This will enable the srcset and the image will be rendered from one among the srcsets generated by Gumlet.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  window.GUMLET_CONFIG = {
    ...
    ...
    srcset: true,
  };
</script>
```

Then, wherever an image tag is used:

- Load the low-resolution image while initial load :

  ```html
  <img
    srcset="imgurl?blur=10 1024w, imgurl?blur=10 640w, imgurl?blur=10 480w"
    sizes="10vw"
  />
  ```

- And For the subsequent load of the high resolution image:

  ```html
  <img
    srcset="imgurl?blur=0 1024w, imgurl?blur=0 640w, imgurl?blur=0 480w"
    sizes="25vw"
  />
  ```

The size and the blur value can be varied based on your preference.
