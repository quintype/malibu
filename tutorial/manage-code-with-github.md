Quintype manages all the products and libraries on Github, you can check it out all the repository here or you may contact support support@quintype.com to get Github access in case if you donâ€™t have.

In this tutorial, we will see how we can take the repository in the local system from Github and will do some changes and pushed it back to Github.

## Cloning Malibu Github repository to the local system

1. We usually follow folder structure something like `work/qt/` and then all the repositories inside this folder.
2. Once you create folder structure now you need to clone the repo - `git clone https://github.com/quintype/malibu.git`.

## Update files locally in Malibu

1. Once you cloned the repository go to the `malibu` folder using `cd malibu`.
2. Create `test` branch - `git checkout -b test` or you can switch to different branch using - `git checkout branch_name`.
3. Let's edit `story.js` file and add one console there.

## Pushing code back to Github

Once you are done with your local changes now time to push your changes to Github. But befor pushing changes to Github you may follow a few steps.

1. Check all changed/updated files - `git status`
2. Add individual files  - `git add file_path` or you can check all the chages using - `git add -p` or add all the files that are updated using `git add .` .
3. Once you have added file to origin now time to commit your changes with message - `git commit -m "your changed message"`
4. Now time to push your changes to Github - `git push origin test`.

You may now proceed to [Docker]({{"/tutorial/docker.html" | absolute_url}}) or jump to a recipe from the [Tutorial]({{"/tutorial" | absolute_url}}).
